# Tree
Tree is an ubiquitous class of Data structures that further extends the idea of Linked list (at least I think so). There are many places where tree may lend itself perfectly to, for example, hierarchical data management or search-oriented applications. As diverse as their applications, there are many types of trees as well, each has its own use cases. An interesting type of trees is Self-balancing Search Tree, which supports fast searching operations. From my experience with Red Black Tree and AVL Tree, these data structures try to relax the constraints of a Balanced Tree but at the same time, the contraints they enforce are sufficient to sensibly upper-bound the height of the tree.
