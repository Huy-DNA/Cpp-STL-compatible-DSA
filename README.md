# Data structure and Algorithm
This is where I store my C++ implementations of data structures and solutions to some algorithmic problems. Hopefully I'll get all of this right.

* My aim is to code as generic as possible, so I'll utilize template and SFINAE techniques in this.
* I'll try to provide as much information as possible in a README file for each implementation here.
