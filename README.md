# Data structure and Algorithm
This is where I store my C++ implementations of data structures and solutions to some algorithmic problems. Hopefully I'll get all of this right. &#128563; &#128563; &#128563; 

* My aim is to code as generic as possible, so I'll utilize template and SFINAE in this. I'm pretty much interested in this so-called metaprogramming thing though &#128541; It often goes like "woaahhh!? Did I just write those awfully beautiful SFINAE???" &#129325;
* I'll try to provide as much information as possible in a README file for each implementation here. It's a way that I revise things and might turn out useful in the future!? &#129488;

Things I've learnt from this:
* When testing written C++ libraries, always include it first before any other standard library. This way, you can figure out what standard library you forget to include in your written libraries.
