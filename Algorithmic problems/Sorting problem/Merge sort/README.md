# Merge sort
Notes about this implementation of merge sort:
* Time complexity:
    * Average-case running time: $O(\lg n)$
    * Best-case running time: $O(\lg n)$
    * Worst-case running time: $O(\lg n)$
* Space complexity: $O(\lg n)$
* Other technical:
    * Stable
    * NOT in-place
    * Only works with random-access iterators (in C++ terminology)
