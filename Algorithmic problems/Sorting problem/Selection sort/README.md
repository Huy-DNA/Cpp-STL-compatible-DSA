# Selection sort
Notes about this implementation of shell sort:
* Time complexity:
    * Average-case running time: $O(n^2)$
    * Best-case running time: $O(n^2)$
    * Worst-case running time: $O(n^2)$
* Space complexity: 
    * Worst-case: $O(1)$
* Other technical:
    * Unstable
    * In-place
    * Only works with random-access iterators (in C++ terminology)
