# Heap sort
Notes about this implementation of insertion sort:
* Time complexity:
    * Average-case running time: $\Theta(\lg n)$
    * Best-case running time: $\Theta(\lg n)$
    * Worst-case running time: $\Theta(\lg n)$
* Space complexity: $\Theta(1)$
* Other technical:
    * Not (inherently) stable
    * In-place
    * Only works with random-access iterators (in C++ terminology)
