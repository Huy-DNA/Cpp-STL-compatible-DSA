# Algorithmic problems
This is where I store classic and generic algorithmic problems, focusing on coding these algorithm as generic as possible rather than applying them to a specific problem.

Things I want to improve:
* (*Done - 31/08/2022 6:38 PM*) Change `std::remove_reference_t<decltype(*Iter())>` to `typename std::iterator_traits<Iter>::value_type`. Too many of them... maybe I'll consider writing a Bash script...
